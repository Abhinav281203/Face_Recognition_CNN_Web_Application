# Face Recognition Web Application with YOLOv5 and MERN Stack

This web application leverages deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLOv5 model, to perform face recognition. It leverages real-time video capturing and sending frames to the backend, which is then processed by the model to recognize and identify individuals. Users should know about data splitting and model training to comprehend and use this code fully. The resulting model weights should be stored in a "static" folder within the same directory as the YOLOv5 code.

This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, enabling the creation of a full-stack solution that integrates deep learning into the backend. To use the application, individuals should replace the necessary credentials in the backend files to connect to their database. Users need to register in the database to upload images for recognition, and dedicated login and signup pages have been designed for this purpose.
